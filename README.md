The xsbt-filter project provides the necessary functionality for filtering resources in an [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt) project. The plugin's functionality is similar to Maven's [resource filtering](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html) mechanism.

Checkout the [wiki](https://gitorious.org/xsbt-plugins/pages/FilterPlugin) for more information.
