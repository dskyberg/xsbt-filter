{"name":"xsbt-filter","body":"[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sdb/xsbt-filter.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sdb/xsbt-filter)\r\n\r\nThe xsbt-filter project provides the necessary functionality for filtering resources in an [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt) project. The plugin's functionality is similar to Maven's [resource filtering](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html) mechanism and is useful when migrating Maven projects that depend heavily on resource filtering.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* sbt 0.11.0 or later\r\n\r\n## Overview \r\n\r\nThis plugin scans your resources (e.g `src/main/resources`, `src/test/resources`) for variables (surrounded by `${` and `}`) and replaces them with values which can come from the system properties, your project properties and filter resources.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have a resource `src/main/resources/hello.txt` containing:\r\n\r\n    Hello, ${name}\r\n\r\nWhen `copy-resources` is executed, this will create a resource output `hello.txt` in the project's classes output directory. The variable (or property reference) `${name}` will be replaced with the name of your project.\r\n\r\nFilter resources are one way to add extra properties which can be used to substitute variables. By default the plug-in looks for filter resources in a `filters` directory under the source directories for the `main` (`compile`) and `test` configurations (`src/main/filters` and `src/test/filters`).\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your plugin configuration (in `project/plugins/build.sbt`):\r\n    \r\n    resolvers += \"sdb@github\" at \"http://sdb.github.com/maven\"\r\n    \r\n    addSbtPlugin(\"com.github.sdb\" % \"xsbt-filter\" % \"0.3\")\r\n\r\nAdd the default filter settings to your project in `build.sbt`:\r\n\r\n    seq(filterSettings: _*)\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nBuild and install the plugin to use the latest SNAPSHOT version:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/sdb/xsbt-filter.git\r\n    cd xsbt-filter\r\n    sbt publish-local\r\n\r\n## Default Configuration\r\n\r\nThe plugin comes with a set of default settings. This is what you get with the default configuration:\r\n\r\n* only `.properties` and `.xml` resources are filtered\r\n* filter resources (only `.properties` and `.xml`) should be placed under a directory `filters`\r\n* the following values are available as replacement values:\r\n  * name, version, scalaVersion and a couple of other build settings (the setting name is used as key)\r\n  * system properties\r\n  * environment variables\r\n  * the user-defined properties defined in filter resources\r\n* resources filtering is triggered when `copy-resources` is executed\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nTake a look at the source code for [FilterPlugin](https://github.com/sdb/xsbt-filter/blob/master/src/FilterPlugin.scala) for all settings.\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your `build.sbt` if you want to change any of the settings provided by this plugin:\r\n\r\n    import FilterKeys._\r\n\r\n### Filter resource paths\r\n\r\nUse the `filter-directory-name` setting to configure the name of the directory containing the filters:\r\n\r\n    filterDirectoryName := \"my-filters\"\r\n\r\nUse the `include-filter` setting to change the file filter that determines which filters to include:\r\n\r\n    includeFilter in (Compile, filters) ~= { f => f || (\"*.props\" | \"*.conf\") }\r\n\r\n### Filtered resource paths\r\n\r\nUse the `include-filter` setting to change the file filter that determines which resources need to be filtered:\r\n\r\n    includeFilter in (Compile, filterResources) ~= { f => f || (\"*.props\" | \"*.conf\") }\r\n\r\n### Properties\r\n\r\nUse the `filter-extra-props` setting to add extra properties to be used as replacement values:\r\n\r\n    extraProps += \"author\" -> \"Foo Bar\"\r\n\r\nUse the `filter-project-props` setting to change the name of the properties which are derived from project settings to avoid collisions with other properties:\r\n\r\n    projectProps ~= { _ map (p => (\"project.\" + p._1, p._2)) }\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the New BSD License.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFork the repository, push your changes to a new branch and send me a merge request.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
